-  Hi, I’m @Psc30.
-  I’m currently learning to be proficient in software engineering, data science, and machine learning from Codecademy.
-  Several of my interests are artifical intelligence, robotics, and space related topics.
-  I'm currently working full time so I usually have little time on github, but I'll try to update my profile every now and then.
